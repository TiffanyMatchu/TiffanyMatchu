### About Me
I am a lifelong learner who enjoys figuring out how things work. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at the University of Maryland Global Campus. After completing my degree, I started my career as a QA Automation Developer. I enjoy delving deep into software applications, dissecting their behavior, and understanding the differences between expected and actual results. I translate acceptance criteria into test cases and add automation to integrate tests to continuously locate bugs before they reach production.
